## Context

Cherry-pit has two idempotency requirements enforced by convention only: command handling (`Ok(vec![])` for duplicate detection per CHE-0008) and policy reactions (same event twice must produce same outputs per CHE-0017). Neither has framework-level enforcement. CHE-0002 says "make illegal states unrepresentable," but idempotency is a behavioral invariant the type system cannot structurally enforce. Three layers matter: command dispatch (user retries), policy reactions (at-least-once delivery), and event persistence (optimistic concurrency via `expected_sequence`). UUID v7 `event_id` (CHE-0033) provides a natural deduplication key.

## Decision

Convention-based idempotency with infrastructure-level support
planned for the `CommandBus`.

R1 [5]: Aggregates are the authority on duplicate detection using
  state rebuilt from events
R2 [5]: Policy::react must be a pure function where same
  EventEnvelope input produces the same Vec<Output>
R3 [5]: Optimistic concurrency via expected_sequence prevents
  duplicate appends at the store level

### Command-level idempotency

No framework idempotency key. Aggregates are the authority on
whether a command is a duplicate.

The aggregate's state (rebuilt from events) contains enough
information to detect duplicates. Examples:

- `CreateOrder` on an already-created aggregate → `handle` inspects
  state, returns `Err(AlreadyCreated)` or `Ok(vec![])`.
- `ConfirmPayment { payment_id }` when `payment_id` is already
  recorded → `handle` returns `Ok(vec![])`.

This approach is correct because the aggregate is the single source
of truth for its own state. External deduplication tables can go
stale; the aggregate cannot.

### Policy-level idempotency

`react` must be a pure function: same `EventEnvelope` input
produces the same `Vec<Output>`. At-least-once delivery is safe
when:

1. `react` is pure (same input → same output), AND
2. Downstream command handling is idempotent (duplicate commands
   produce zero events).

Together, replaying an event through a policy and re-dispatching
the resulting commands produces no additional state changes. The
system converges to the same state regardless of delivery count.

No deduplication table or processed-event tracking is required at
the policy level if both conditions hold.

### Store-level idempotency

Optimistic concurrency (`expected_sequence` on `append`) prevents
duplicate appends. If two concurrent attempts to append after the
same load race, one succeeds and the other receives
`StoreError::ConcurrencyConflict`. The caller retries with a fresh
load.

UUID v7 `event_id` uniqueness (CHE-0033) prevents exact-duplicate
events: two events produced by different `handle` calls will always
have different `event_id` values. This is not deduplication — it is
identity.

### Future: CommandBus idempotency key

When the `CommandBus` is implemented, it may add optional
idempotency key support for commands entering from external sources
(webhooks, message queues). Design sketch:

```rust
// Optional idempotency key on CommandGateway
fn send_idempotent<C>(
    &self,
    id: AggregateId,
    cmd: C,
    idempotency_key: IdempotencyKey,
    context: CorrelationContext,
) -> impl Future<Output = DispatchResult<Self::Aggregate, C>> + Send
where ...;
```

The bus would check a deduplication store before dispatching. If the
key has been seen, it returns the original result without
re-executing the command. This is infrastructure-level deduplication
layered on top of the domain-level idempotency.

This is deferred until `CommandBus` is built and the external
command ingestion pattern is concrete.

## Consequences

- **Type-system boundary acknowledged.** Idempotency is behavioral; the compiler cannot verify it. Convention + documentation is the pragmatic answer.
- **Aggregate is the idempotency authority.** No external deduplication table needed — the aggregate's state IS the deduplication state.
- **Policy purity is the key invariant.** If `react` is pure AND downstream handling is idempotent, at-least-once delivery is safe without policy-level deduplication. Testing should verify purity (CHE-0038).
- **`event_id` (UUID v7) is a natural deduplication key** for external systems receiving events.
- **No automatic retry** — `Command` has no `Clone` (CHE-0014), so callers must reconstruct and re-dispatch.
