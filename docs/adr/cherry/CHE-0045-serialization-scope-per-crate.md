## Context

Cherry-pit is a multi-crate workspace (CHE-0029) spanning domain traits
(`cherry-pit-core`), infrastructure adapters (`cherry-pit-gateway`), and an optional
event serialization and storage layer (`pardosa`, `pardosa-genome`).
Two serialization decisions exist:

1. **CHE-0031** — MessagePack named encoding for `cherry-pit-gateway`'s
   `MsgpackFileStore`. Optimised for forward-compatible event
   persistence with `#[serde(default)]` field evolution.
2. **PAR-0006** — pardosa-genome as the primary
   serialization for the `pardosa` crate. Optimised for zero-copy
   reads, compile-time schema hashing, and integrated compression.

Without explicit scoping, these decisions appear contradictory:
both claim to be the "primary" serialization format. In practice
they serve different crates with different performance and
compatibility requirements.

## Decision

Each crate owns its serialization strategy. No crate's choice
constrains another's.

| Crate | Serialization | Governing ADR |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| `cherry-pit-core` | None — domain traits are format-agnostic. `DomainEvent: Serialize + DeserializeOwned` enables any serde backend. | CHE-0010 |
| `cherry-pit-gateway` | MessagePack with named/map encoding (`rmp-serde`). Forward-compatible field evolution via `#[serde(default)]`. | CHE-0031 |
| `pardosa` | pardosa-genome as primary. MsgPack and JSON as feature-gated fallbacks for debugging and interop. | PAR-0006 |
| `pardosa-genome` | Defines the genome binary wire format. Serde-native with `GenomeSafe` marker trait. | GEN-0001 through GEN-0033 |
| `cherry-pit-web` (planned) | JSON via `serde_json` for HTTP API responses. Format determined by web conventions, not event storage. | — |

### Boundary Rules

1. **Domain events are format-agnostic.** A domain event type defined
   in user code works with any serde-compatible backend. The choice of
   MsgPack vs. genome vs. JSON is made at the infrastructure layer,
   not the domain layer.
2. **No crate may mandate a serialization format for another crate.**
   `cherry-pit-gateway` does not require genome. `pardosa` does not require
   MsgPack. Both coexist as alternative `EventStore` implementations.
3. **Feature flags gate serialization dependencies.** The `genome`
   feature in `pardosa` gates the `pardosa-genome` dependency. The
   `json` feature gates `serde_json`. Users opt in explicitly.
4. **Event envelope wire format is store-specific.** The `EventEnvelope`
   schema (CHE-0016, CHE-0042) is serialised by the store implementation,
   not by the domain. Different stores may use different encodings for
   the same logical envelope.

## Consequences

- **No conflict between CHE-0031 and PAR-0006.** They govern
  different crates with different requirements. Users choosing
  `cherry-pit-gateway` get MsgPack. Users choosing `pardosa` get genome.
  Users can use both in the same application for different aggregates.
- **Domain event portability.** Because `cherry-pit-core` is format-agnostic,
  domain events can be serialised by any backend. Migrating from
  `MsgpackFileStore` to a future `GenomeFileStore` requires no domain
  code changes.
- **Schema evolution strategies differ by crate.** `cherry-pit-gateway` uses
  additive field evolution with `#[serde(default)]` (CHE-0022).
  `pardosa` uses new-stream migration with log rewriting (PAR-0005).
  Both are valid within their scope.
- **Increased surface area.** Two serialization strategies means two
  sets of golden-file tests, two sets of forward-compatibility
  guarantees, and two encoding-specific bug surfaces.
