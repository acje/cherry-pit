## Context

IEEE 754 NaN allows ~2^52 distinct bit patterns for f64. NaN payloads are used for NaN-boxing and diagnostic tagging. Different architectures produce different NaN payloads for the same arithmetic, so identical computations on different platforms yield different NaN bits. GEN-0012 states NaN bit patterns are preserved but does not document the rationale. Two approaches: canonicalization (Cap'n Proto — replaces all NaN with a single canonical value, destroying payloads) or bit-pattern preservation (round-trips exact `to_bits()`, no cross-platform byte equality for NaN-producing arithmetic).

## Decision

pardosa-genome preserves exact NaN bit patterns. No canonicalization.
`f64::NAN.to_bits()` round-trips exactly through `to_le_bytes()` /
`from_le_bytes()`.

Floats are serialized as raw LE IEEE 754 bytes. The serializer performs no
inspection or modification of the bit pattern. The deserializer reads the
raw bytes and converts via `from_le_bytes` — no NaN detection, no payload
masking, no quiet/signaling conversion.

R1 [9]: Preserve exact NaN bit patterns with no canonicalization —
  f64::NAN.to_bits() round-trips exactly
R2 [9]: The serializer performs no inspection or modification of float
  bit patterns
R3 [9]: The deserializer reads raw bytes via from_le_bytes with no NaN
  detection or payload masking

## Consequences

- **Positive:** Bit-fidelity preserved — NaN-boxing and payload tagging round-trip without loss. Zero overhead on hot path.
- **Positive:** Value-level determinism: same `to_bits()` always produces same bytes.
- **Negative:** Cross-platform determinism NOT guaranteed for NaN-producing arithmetic. Different architectures may produce different NaN payloads, affecting content-addressable storage across heterogeneous clusters.
- **Negative:** `-0.0` and `+0.0` serialize differently despite `==` equality. Applications needing byte-equivalent zeros must canonicalize at the application level.
- **Mitigation:** Canonicalize NaN values at the application level before serialization if cross-platform byte equality is required.
