## Context

Every major binary format has been fuzzed: Protobuf (OSS-Fuzz),
FlatBuffers (AFL), Cap'n Proto (Sandstorm). Genome's `forbid(unsafe_code)`
eliminates memory corruption but not logic bugs: incorrect offset
arithmetic, integer overflow, panics on crafted input. GEN-0011 catalogs
20 checks; GEN-0032 provides verify_roundtrip. Neither addresses
adversarial input. Pardosa processes events from NATS — a network
boundary requiring codec robustness.

1. **Structured fuzzing + proptest** — continuous adversarial coverage.
2. **Manual test vectors** — curated, incomplete by construction.
3. **Verification checks only** — untested against adversarial craft.

Option 1 chosen: automated fuzzing catches bugs manual testing cannot.

## Decision

Maintain continuous fuzz targets and property-based roundtrip tests
for both decode paths (bare message and file format).

R1 [5]: Run cargo-fuzz targets against decode_bare and decode_file
  with arbitrary byte slices, targeting zero panics on any input
R2 [5]: Use proptest to verify roundtrip identity: for all T where
  T implements GenomeSafe, decode(encode(t)) equals t
R3 [6]: Fuzz targets cover all PageClass configurations from
  GEN-0013 to exercise resource limit enforcement under adversarial
  input
R4 [5]: Maintain a coverage matrix mapping fuzz and proptest cases to
  each GEN-0011 verification check and each wire-layout type
R5 [5]: Golden malformed-input fixtures cover header, footer, offset,
  padding, compression, checksum, and schema-hash rejection paths

## Consequences

Fuzzing catches offset arithmetic, overflow, and parser panic bugs unreachable by examples. CI runs are time-bounded, with longer scheduled runs. The coverage matrix keeps fuzzing tied to GEN-0011 instead of becoming unspecific random testing.
