## Context

Schema hashing in pardosa-genome uses `stringify!` to produce canonical Rust type
definitions at compile time (GEN-0003). This is inherently Rust-specific — the schema
source text contains Rust syntax (`struct Player { name: String, hp: u32 }`), and the
hash is computed from this Rust-specific representation.

Cross-language serialization formats (FlatBuffers, Cap'n Proto, Protocol Buffers) use
language-neutral IDL files and code generators. pardosa-genome does not have an IDL —
the Rust type definition _is_ the schema.

[genome.md](../../genome.md) §Future Scope already identifies an "Exportable Schema
Definition Format" as a future direction.

## Decision

pardosa-genome v1 is Rust-only. No cross-language interoperability guarantees in this
version. The schema hash, schema source, and wire format are stable, but readers in
other languages must reverse-engineer layout from the embedded schema source text
(GEN-0009) or a future schema export format.

Cross-language **read-only** support (non-Rust readers consuming Rust-written genome
files) is deferred to a future version. The path forward:

1. Define a language-neutral schema export format (JSON/binary description of types,
   field names, offsets, alignment).
2. Embed the export alongside the Rust schema source in file headers.
3. Build read-only libraries for target languages using the export.
4. Writing remains Rust-only (requires `GenomeSafe` derive + serde).

## Consequences

- **Positive:** No IDL complexity. Rust types are the single source of truth.
- **Positive:** `stringify!`-based hashing is simple, deterministic, and zero-dependency.
- **Negative:** Non-Rust consumers cannot read genome files without custom parsers.
- **Negative:** Schema hash depends on Rust syntax — any future IDL must produce
  compatible hashes or define a separate hash namespace.
- **Mitigated:** The wire format (GEN-0007, GEN-0012) is language-neutral by construction
  (LE integers, offsets, heap regions). Only schema identification is Rust-specific.
