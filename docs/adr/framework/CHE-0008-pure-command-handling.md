## Context

In event-sourced systems, command handling is the decision point:
inspect current state, validate invariants, produce events. The purity
of this function determines testability, determinism, and the ability
to reason about aggregate behavior.

Two design approaches:

1. **Mutable handler** — `handle(&mut self, cmd: C)` mutates state
   directly. Events are a side product or afterthought. Testing
   requires inspecting internal state.
2. **Pure handler** — `handle(&self, cmd: C) -> Result<Vec<Event>,
   Error>`. The handler inspects state (shared reference) and returns
   events. State changes happen only when events are applied via
   `apply`. Testing is pure function testing: given state + command,
   assert events or error.

## Decision

`HandleCommand::handle(&self, cmd: C) -> Result<Vec<Self::Event>,
Self::Error>`.

Three constraints enforce the pattern:

1. **`&self` receiver** — shared reference prevents direct mutation
   of aggregate fields. State changes happen exclusively through
   events returned by `handle`, then applied via `apply`.
2. **Command consumed by value** (`cmd: C`, not `&C`) — a command
   represents one-time intent. After handling, it is consumed. No
   cloning, no re-use without explicit reconstruction.
3. **Pure return type** — `Result<Vec<Event>, Error>` is plain data.
   No futures, no side effects in the type signature.

Documentation mandates: "Must be pure — no I/O, no side effects."

## Consequences

- Command handlers are trivially testable: construct an aggregate,
  apply setup events, call `handle`, assert returned events or
  error. No mocks, no I/O setup.
- The `&self` + `apply` separation creates a two-phase state update:
  `handle` decides, `apply` mutates. This is the canonical event-
  sourcing pattern.
- **Purity is convention, not compiler-enforced.** `&self` prevents
  mutation of `self`, but nothing prevents I/O (network calls, file
  reads, `println!`), accessing global mutable state (`static`,
  `AtomicU64`), or calling non-deterministic functions (`rand`,
  `Timestamp::now`). Enforcement relies on code review and
  documentation.
- No `Clone` requirement on commands (CHE-0014) means the framework
  cannot retry by replaying the same command — the caller must
  reconstruct it. This is consistent with one-time intent semantics.
- Zero events returned (`Ok(vec![])`) means the command was accepted
  but no state change occurred — idempotent acceptance. The
  infrastructure persists nothing and publishes nothing.
