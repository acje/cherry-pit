## Context

Pardosa's publish path is rigorously specified (PAR-0007, PAR-0008) but
the consume path has zero ADRs. JetStream supports AckExplicit, AckAll,
and AckNone — each with different failure modes. Without explicit policy,
consumers choose ad-hoc: AckNone loses events on crash, AckAll creates
head-of-line blocking. An event published but never consumed is data loss.

1. **AckExplicit + bounded redelivery** — per-event ACK, dead-letter on
   exhaustion. Highest safety.
2. **AckAll + checkpoint** — batch ACK, reprocess from checkpoint on crash.
3. **AckNone** — fire-and-forget.

Option 1 chosen per CHE-0001 P1 (correctness-first).

## Decision

All Pardosa consumers use JetStream AckExplicit pull subscriptions
with bounded redelivery and a dead-letter subject for poison messages.

R1 [5]: All JetStream consumers use AckExplicit acknowledgment policy
  with pull-based subscriptions for explicit flow control
R2 [5]: Configure MaxDeliver on each consumer to bound redelivery
  attempts and route exhausted messages to a dead-letter subject
R3 [5]: Track consumer position via JetStream durable consumer name
  so subscriptions resume from the last acknowledged sequence on restart
R4 [8]: Consumers acknowledge each event only after successful
  processing to prevent data loss on crash
R5 [5]: Consumer handlers persist idempotency state keyed by stream,
  sequence, and durable consumer name before acknowledging messages
R6 [5]: Dead-letter records include stream, sequence, event_id,
  delivery count, error category, and correlation_id for repair

## Consequences

Publish and consume paths now both have explicit correctness contracts. AckExplicit adds per-message overhead but prevents crash loss. Durable consumers resume from the last ACK. Poison messages become repairable dead letters instead of infinite retries or silent drops.
