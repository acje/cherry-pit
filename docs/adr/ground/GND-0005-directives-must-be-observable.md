## Context

The effects gap in GND-0001 — the difference between intended and
actual outcome — closes only when the system can observe the result.
A directive whose violation cannot be detected is a wish: it cannot
fail loudly, it cannot trigger review, it cannot compound into evidence
of drift. Observation is the precondition for every feedback loop in
GND-0006, GND-0007, and GND-0008.

Three options:

1. **Trust compliance** — assume directives are followed. Drift is
   discovered through unrelated incidents, late.
2. **Audit periodically** — schedule manual review. Episodic; delay
   between violation and detection is unbounded.
3. **Embed observability in the directive itself** — every directive
   names the mechanism — test, lint, type constraint, metric, review
   gate — by which a violation surfaces.

Option 3 chosen: it is the only option that closes the effects gap
on a timescale comparable to the rate of change.

## Decision

Every directive declares at least one mechanism by which a violation
of its intent becomes detectable. The mechanism is named in the
directive itself; absence of a mechanism is a defect, not an
optional enhancement.

R1 [3]: Name in every ADR's Decision or Consequences section at
  least one observation mechanism — automated test, lint, type
  invariant, runtime metric, telemetry assertion, or review-gate
  checklist — that surfaces a violation of the directive's intent
R2 [3]: Prefer observation mechanisms that surface violations
  before integration — type constraints, lints, compile-fail tests
  — over mechanisms that surface violations only at runtime, because
  earlier signal closes the effects gap on a tighter loop
R3 [3]: Treat directives with no named observation mechanism as
  drafts regardless of declared status; they are unenforceable
  until observability is specified

## Consequences

- **Strengthens the effects-gap response.** Without observability
  a directive cannot participate in the feedback loops downstream.
- **Retroactive cost.** Existing ADRs across COM, RST, CHE, PAR,
  GEN, SEC, and AFM that name no observation mechanism become
  candidates for amendment. Migration is per-tier, S first.
- **Aligns with COM-0019.** COM-0019 implements observability for
  software components; GND-0005 is the principle COM-0019 instantiates
  at the software-design level. COM-0019's structural parent re-points
  to GND-0005 on adoption.
- **Constrains the template.** Future evolutions of TEMPLATE.md
  may add a dedicated Observability field; out of scope here, in
  scope for AFM.
