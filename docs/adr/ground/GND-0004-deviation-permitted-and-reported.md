## Context

Truppenführung (1933): *"a failure to act or a delay is a more
serious fault than making a mistake in the choice of means."* Under
GND-0001 uncertainty, the executor at the point of contact has
information the directive's issuer did not. Forbidding deviation
forces the executor to choose between violating intent and obeying
form — both fail. Permitting silent deviation lets the system drift
out of alignment.

Three options:

1. **Forbid deviation** — directives are absolute. Executor stalls
   or violates intent to preserve form.
2. **Permit silent deviation** — executor adjusts without report.
   Drift accumulates undetected.
3. **Permit deviation; require report** — executor adjusts when
   intent demands it, then surfaces the deviation so the directive
   itself can be revised.

Option 3 chosen: it pairs autonomy at the point of contact with
the feedback signal needed to keep directives current.

## Decision

Deviation from a directive in service of its higher intent is
permitted. The deviation is reported through a defined channel so
the directive's issuer can confirm, refine, or revise.

R1 [3]: Treat deviation from a directive's literal text as
  permitted when the executor's action serves the directive's
  stated intent or the parent intent it sits within, because intent
  outranks form under irreducible uncertainty
R2 [3]: Record every deviation in a channel the directive's owner
  monitors — change log entry, ADR amendment proposal, or incident
  artefact — naming the directive ID, the action taken, and the
  intent served, because silent deviation accumulates as drift
R3 [3]: Treat three or more recorded deviations against the same
  directive as evidence the directive is mis-scoped and trigger
  review under GND-0007 lifecycle hygiene

## Consequences

- **Pairs with GND-0002.** Intent-stated directives make principled
  deviation possible; this ADR establishes the reporting half.
- **Cost.** The reporting channel is overhead. Without it, deviation
  is silent and the corpus drifts. With it, deviations become
  signal: the directive learns from its own friction.
- **Replaces blame with evidence.** Deviation is not failure; it is
  data about where the directive's scope no longer matches reality.
- **Connects to lifecycle.** The supersession trigger in GND-0007
  consumes the deviation log as one of its inputs.
- **Observation mechanism (per GND-0005).** Review-gate checklist:
  deviations are recorded in commit messages or ADR amendments
  citing the directive ID; periodic corpus review correlates
  recurring deviations against directives and feeds the GND-0007
  lifecycle trigger.
