## Context

All SEC ADRs address application-level security; none cover the supply
chain. The xz-utils incident (CVE-2024-3094) demonstrates dependency
supply chain is the highest-impact attack vector. A compromised dependency
with `unsafe` undermines SEC-0004, SEC-0002, and SEC-0001. RST-0004
covers cargo-audit but no security ADR governs the threat model.

1. **Automated auditing** — `cargo-deny` + `cargo-audit` + pinned lock.
2. **First-party attestation** — `cargo-vet`. Higher assurance, higher
   burden.
3. **Status quo** — RST-0004 alone. Known advisories only.

Option 1 chosen; cargo-vet deferred until dependency count justifies it.

## Decision

Enforce automated dependency auditing in CI covering advisories,
license compliance, banned crates, and unsafe surface area.

R1 [5]: Run cargo-deny in CI checking advisories, licenses, bans,
  and duplicate dependency versions on every pull request
R2 [5]: Pin all dependencies via committed Cargo.lock to ensure
  reproducible builds and detect supply chain substitution
R3 [6]: Run cargo-geiger periodically to report transitive unsafe
  code surface area, flagged for review when new unsafe appears
R4 [5]: Dependency updates follow RST-0002 dedicated-PR discipline
  with cargo tree diff included in the PR description
R5 [6]: CI runs cargo-deny against advisories, licenses, bans,
  and source registries before merging dependency changes
R6 [6]: Dependency review records cargo-deny warnings, cargo tree
  diffs, and new unsafe transitive code before accepting updates

## Consequences

Application-level SEC rules now rest on an audited dependency foundation. cargo-deny adds CI friction and may require deny.toml exceptions. cargo-vet remains deferred until dependency volume or risk justifies first-party attestation.
