## Context

Martin (Clean Architecture, Ch. 22) and Cockburn's Hexagonal Architecture formalize the same principle: source code dependencies must point inward toward higher-level policy. Inner layers define abstractions; outer layers implement them. This is distinct from COM-0004 (what each layer abstracts) — the dependency rule addresses which direction knowledge flows.

Cherry-pit's crate DAG embodies this: `cherry-pit-core` defines traits knowing nothing about MessagePack or file I/O. Gateway and web crates depend on core, never the reverse. The Cargo workspace (CHE-0029) enforces this physically — circular dependencies are compile errors. Violation patterns include domain types carrying serialization annotations.

## Decision

Source code dependencies point inward. Inner layers define
abstractions; outer layers implement them. No inner layer may
reference, import, or depend on an outer layer.

R1 [2]: Traits, domain types, and error types are defined in the
  innermost layer that uses them; outer layers depend on these
  definitions, never the reverse
R2 [2]: Data crossing boundaries is converted to the inner layer's
  types at the boundary; inner layers never handle serialization
  formats or transport types
R3 [2]: Domain logic must not reference infrastructure concerns —
  serialization libraries, database clients, network protocols,
  or file system operations
R4 [3]: The Cargo crate DAG makes dependency violations a compile
  error; logical layering within a crate uses module visibility
R5 [2]: When an inner layer needs an outer capability, define a
  trait in the inner layer and implement it in the outer layer

## Consequences

The crate DAG is the primary enforcement — adding a dependency from `cherry-pit-core` to `pardosa` or `cherry-pit-web` is a compile error. Domain types remain free of serialization annotations; GEN-0001 and CHE-0045 confine serde derives to infrastructure crates. New infrastructure ports (CHE-0044) can be added without modifying inner-layer traits. COM-0004 and COM-0012 are complementary: one ensures layers add value, the other ensures unidirectional flow. The rule creates intentional friction when core traits evolve, encouraging stable interfaces (COM-0002).
