## Context

Multiple crates independently converged on the same concurrency
pattern: CHE-0006 mandates single-writer per aggregate, PAR-0004
mandates single-writer per stream, SEC-0006 mandates eliminating
race conditions by construction. Each domain discovered that
shared mutable state defended by fine-grained locks produces
correctness bugs, subtle data races, and reasoning difficulty that
exceeds the complexity budget (COM-0001). The pattern recurs
because it reflects a fundamental force: concurrent mutation of
the same logical entity requires either serialization (locks,
queues) or partitioning (single owner). Partitioning eliminates
contention entirely, making the absence of races structurally
guaranteed rather than tested.

## Decision

Single-writer ownership is a workspace-wide foundational
invariant. Every mutable resource has exactly one writer at any
point in time, enforced by partitioning rather than shared-state
synchronization.

R1 [2]: Each mutable resource has exactly one owning writer;
  concurrent write access to the same logical entity is a design
  error, not a synchronization problem
R2 [2]: Prefer ownership partitioning (sharding, actor isolation,
  channel-based hand-off) over shared-state locking as the primary
  concurrency mechanism
R3 [3]: Where shared reads are required, use read-only snapshots
  or immutable projections rather than read-write lock sharing
R4 [3]: Document the single-writer boundary for each stateful
  component, identifying what entity owns the write path

## Consequences

Domain crates can reason about state transitions sequentially,
eliminating an entire class of concurrency bugs. The existing
decisions in CHE-0006 and PAR-0004 become instances of this
foundation rule rather than independent choices. New crates inherit
the invariant automatically via foundation context (AFM-0015).
Shared-nothing architectures scale horizontally but require
explicit coordination for cross-partition operations — addressed
by saga patterns (CHE-0040) and idempotency (CHE-0041).
