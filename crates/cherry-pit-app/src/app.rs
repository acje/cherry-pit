//!
//! v0.1 surface: [`App::new`] (five-slot constructor, no `Default`
//! per CHE-0039:R2 + CHE-0051:R3), [`App::register_policy`]
//! (per-policy dispatch closure per CHE-0051:R4 + CHE-0017:R2), and

//!
//! The policy registry stores

//! `(Policy, dispatch_closure)` adapter, not `Box<dyn Policy>`.
//! CHE-0005:R1 forbids erasing aggregate-bound infra ports; this
