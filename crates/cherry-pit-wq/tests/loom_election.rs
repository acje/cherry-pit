//! Layer 2 (F2) — loom exhaustive-interleaving models of the CURRENT
//! election path vs increment B's lock-free debit.
//!
//! `budget.rs`'s `BudgetGate` and `token_bucket.rs`'s `TokenBucketRegulator`
//! are the frozen/graduated production types (`std::sync::atomic`) — they
//! cannot be loom-model-checked directly without recompiling their internals
//! against `loom::sync::atomic` (which would require `#[cfg(loom)]` shims in
//! `src/budget.rs`, out of scope: the frozen path must not be touched, per
//! this mission's `out_of_scope`/`abort_if`). This file instead builds SMALL
//! structural analogues, under loom's own atomics, that reproduce each
//! design's actual synchronization *shape*:
//!
//! - [`MiniElectionGate`] mirrors `BudgetGate::acquire`'s three-branch CAS
//!   loop verbatim in structure: (1) CAS-increment while under limit: (2)
//!   CAS `false -> true` on a `resetting` flag to elect a single resetter,
//!   which resets the counter and clears the flag; (3) losers spin-wait for
//!   the flag to clear. This is the coordination CURRENT requires: THREE
//!   pieces of shared mutable state (`calls`, `resetting`, plus the
//!   spin/park choreography) that every thread must serialize through once
//!   the epoch is exhausted.
//! - [`MiniTokenBucketDebit`] mirrors `TokenBucketRegulator::try_debit_one`'s
//!   single CAS loop: ONE atomic counter, no election flag, no separate
//!   reset step — a thread either wins its own CAS or retries, with no
//!   shared "am I the elected resetter" state at all.
//!
//! Both models are checked under `loom::model` with an external counter
//! recording how many distinct interleavings loom explores, giving a direct
//! quantitative contrast: CURRENT's extra coordination state produces a
//! larger explored state space for the same thread count than B's model,
//! which is the loom-level analogue of `spec/fizzbee/budget_gate.fizz`
//! (81 nodes/39 states) vs `token_bucket.fizz` (61/61) in Layer 3.
//!
//! Run with: `RUSTFLAGS="--cfg loom" cargo test --release --test loom_election`.
