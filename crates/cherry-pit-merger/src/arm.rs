//! [`MergerArm`] trait: the per-aggregate command-handling shape that
//! makes the merger aggregate-agnostic.
//!
//! Each consumer implements [`MergerArm`] for its aggregate's command
//! type, supplying [`MergerArm::persist_mode`] (the persist
//! strategy), [`MergerArm::handle`] (the pure load-then-handle step
//! against the merger's [`Aggregate::apply`]-replayed state), and
//! [`MergerArm::publish_label`] (the bus-failure log label).
//!
//! A trait, not an enum, because the merger cannot know any
//! consumer's command type at compile time and type-erasure would
//! defeat the single-aggregate compile-time guarantee; the consumer
//! writes the exhaustive matcher inside its own `handle` impl per
//! [CHE-0069:R2].
//!
//! [`MergerArm::Err`] must implement `From<StoreError>` so the merger
//! can lift persist-side failures (load, create, append, concurrency
//! conflict) into the arm's domain error shape uniformly; see
//! [CHE-0069:R5].
//!

/// The three variants correspond to the three persist shapes fixed
/// in [CHE-0069:R3]:
///
/// - [`PersistMode::Create`] — fresh aggregate per call, no
///   domain-key lookup or fold; the merger calls
///   [`EventStore::create`] directly against a default-constructed
///   state.
/// - [`PersistMode::CreateOrAppend`] — lazy create-or-append by
///   domain key: the merger looks the key up in the routing index,
///   folds prior envelopes if any, calls [`MergerArm::handle`], then
///   either [`EventStore::create`]s (first reference) or
///   [`EventStore::append`]s against the tracked `expected_sequence`
///   (subsequent references).
/// - [`PersistMode::AppendStrict`] — strict append requiring an
///   existing routing-index entry; a miss returns
///   [`MergerArm::missing_key_error`] without touching the store.
